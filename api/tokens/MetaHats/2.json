   "name":"HEAVY Rare Avastars Top Hat",
   "description":"Avastars were the second PFP project to gain traction after Cryptopunks, and also featured top hats like Cryptopunks, but in both a men’s and women’s style. When Avastars completed its Generation 1 Primes series at 25,200, this made male top hats an extremely Rare 1.4% of the teleporting population. We added a Rare Blue inside brim to further distinguish it from the crowd. With our hat, we honor not only the Avastars project, but also one of its most famous collectors - WhaleShark, who adopted Avastar #63 as his profile pic - by making #63 the liner. WhaleShark has gone on to collect 37 Avastars (only 26 more to go, buddy!), including the Genesis Primes #0 (female) and #1 (male).  And as a result of Whaleshark’s innovative fractional NFT social token and Vault, the $WHALE community has reached iconic status both in and out of the NFT space.",
