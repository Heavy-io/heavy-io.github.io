   "description":"Now these hats are on FIRE! As a visibly unique wearable meme - these definitely Seize the Memes of Production! A brimstone inner brim, white trim, and Fire body rate this as an Uncommonly good way to showcase your insider knowledge of one of the most important ETH improvements since its founding, where EIP 1559 now burns an average of 7 ETH per minute. Hello UltraSound Money! ATTENTION HEAVY 1559 MEME HAT OWNERS!! On January 5, 2022, at 00:59am UTC (as close to 01/5:59 as we could get), any remaining Heavy MetaHats that have not been sold will be burned at the stake, reducing their supply to an unknown quantity. ADDITIONALLY, we will release free-to-claim multi-metaverse compatible versions of the MetaHat to all hodlers on that date, and announce on our Discord the details of our upcoming Burn-to-Redeem program involving major music NFT momints... This GLB model file also currently comes with an unlockable VOX file that you can immediately use in Cryptovoxels.",
